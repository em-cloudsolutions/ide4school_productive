# The Game 🎮

**Do you like challenges? Play a `coding Game` that test your `skills` in creating algorithms. The proposed challenges have different difficulty levels, which make the game suitable for both beginner and experienced programmers.**

**What are you waiting for? Test yourself and challenge friends and colleagues 😎.**

**As a computer engineering student and creator of this project, I would recommend tools like this as `educational`👨‍🎓 support in schools and universities. Thanks to targeted design choices and an advanced code debugging system _(with time travel)_, The Game tries to provide the best developer experience and guide the student's `reasoning` in each challenge.**
